Cloud Prototype
===============

A simple application creating a cloud of colored particles. The particle
positions and intensities are all provided from the JavaScript context in
order to create high amounts of traffic between the WebGL server and client.

The purpose of the prototype is to measure the performance impact of using
several mutiplexed VBOs.
